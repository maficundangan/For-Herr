    <p>Haiii Chezka!</p>
    <p>Okay, this might sound super random (and maybe even a little weird..), but I wanted to say this before sembreak starts. I know, itâ€™s literally the most random timing to confess right before a long break. Hehehe I kinda planned it that way though ðŸ˜­ I guess I just didnâ€™t want to keep it to myself anymore.</p>
    <p>Please donâ€™t find this creepy or anything! I swear itâ€™s nothing like that. I just really admire you as a person. Yes, I like you. Youâ€™re one of those people who make everything feel lighter without even realizing it. Youâ€™re super kind, caring, responsible, and honestly one of the funniest people ever. You make people laugh without even trying, and I think thatâ€™s such a rare kind of charm.</p>
    <p>You have this energy that makes everyone around you feel safe and comfortable. I notice how you treat people, how patient and warm you are, even in small moments.. and I think thatâ€™s what made me start liking you. Itâ€™s not just your humor or your personality (though those are definitely part of it hehe), itâ€™s more of how genuine you are. You never pretend to be someone else, and thatâ€™s something I really admire.</p>
    <p>Medyo OA pero it's true ha!</p>
    <p>Weâ€™re not that close, but I know you're a really great person! I'm not expecting anything back, okay? I really wanted to let it out and tell you how I feel. We're pretty awkward at the moment, and that's really on me hehe..I also just wanted you to know that someone out here really, really thinks youâ€™re amazing. You make peopleâ€™s days better just by being you.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I hope this doesnâ€™t make things weird ðŸ˜… and I hope we won't be awkward. I just wanted to be honest for once, before the break starts. I hope you enjoy your wellness break, get lots of rest, and do all the things that make you happy. You deserve it, Chezka ðŸ’—</p>
    <p>With love, <br><b>Mafi ðŸ’•</b></p>
